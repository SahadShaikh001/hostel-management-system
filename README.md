# hostel-management-system
Designed and developed a responsive Hostel Management System to streamline hostel operations 
such as resident admissions, room bookings, payments, and feedback management. The system 
includes a user-friendly front end for residents and a secure admin dashboard for hostel staff. It 
enables real-time room availability checking, resident profile management, payment status tracking, 
and report generation. The application follows a modular architecture and includes authentication 
and authorization features.
